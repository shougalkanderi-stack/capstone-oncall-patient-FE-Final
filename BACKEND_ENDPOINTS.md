# Backend Endpoints Status

## ✅ Working Endpoints

### Authentication
- `POST /auth/login` - Patient login ✅
- `POST /auth/register` - Patient registration ✅

### Appointments
- `POST /bookings` - Book new appointment ✅

## ❌ Missing Endpoints (Need to be implemented)

### Authentication
- `GET /auth/me` - Get current user profile ❌
- `POST /auth/logout` - Logout user ❌

### Appointments
- `GET /appointments/me` - Get patients appointments ❌
- `GET /doctors/available` - Get available doctors ❌
- `DELETE /appointments/:id` - Cancel appointment ❌
- `GET /appointments/:id` - Get appointment details ❌
- `GET /doctors/:id/slots` - Get doctors available slots ❌

## 🔧 Current Implementation

### What Works Now:
1. **Login/Register** - Uses your backend endpoints
2. **Book Appointments** - Uses `POST /bookings` endpoint
3. **Profile Display** - Shows mock data until `/auth/me` is implemented4*Appointments List** - Shows empty list until `/appointments/me` is implemented

### How to Test Booking:

1. **Login** to your app
2. **Click Book Appointment"** button
3. **Fill in the form**:
   - Doctor ID (you need to provide this)
   - Appointment Type (e.g., "General Checkup")
   - Date and Time
   - Optional notes
4. **Submit** - This will call `POST /bookings` with your data

### Expected Booking Request:
```json
{
  "doctorId": "doctor123,
 date:20240115,
  time": 10type": "General Checkup",
  notes:Optional notes"
}
```

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Test the booking functionality** with your `POST /bookings` endpoint
2lement the missing endpoints** in your backend:
   - `GET /auth/me` - Return current user profile
   - `GET /appointments/me` - Return users appointments
   - `GET /doctors/available` - Return list of available doctors

3. **Update the frontend** once you implement the missing endpoints

## 🔍 Testing

To test if booking works, try booking an appointment and check:
- Your backend logs for the `POST /bookings` request
- The frontend console for success/error messages
- Your database to see if the booking was created
